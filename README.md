# .Hitman
This is the first version .Hitman, an _automated shutdown sequencer_ for Windows. Developed around 2018, it is full of bugs, bad code, and overall, mistakes not to make when developing an application.
It is also not optimized and would crash more often than adobe premier. 

# Why this repository
This repository could help new developers understand simple mistakes to avoid when developing an application. At the time I wrote .Hitman, I was young and didn't know any programming patron. 
.Hitman was _working_ fine, and that was it. I didn't care about optimization nor code cleaning.
I made this code available to the public and added some comments explaining my mistakes and what **not** to do! If you anything wrong with my code or explanation, please, feel free to help me explaining my mistakes in the code.
I believe we can learn a lot from past mistakes, and if I can help others where I failed myself, this repository will be a huge success.
