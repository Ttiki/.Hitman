					<img src="../resources/web/hitman_legend.png" caption="A view from the app" style="margin: auto; width: 300px; float: right; margin-top: -100px"/>
					<p>To use this software, just start it, use the slides (1) to adjust the countdown before shutdowning your computer.</br>
					Whenever you are ready, press the BIG RED BUTTON (2)! A confirmation pop up will appear, just click ok to continu or cancel to... cancel. If you press ok some Windows consoles will pop up, don't worry, <span style="font-weight: bold;">IT'S NORMAL</span>. Just leave your computer, let your thing goes as normal!<br/></p>
					<br/>
					<h3>If you messed up some thing or simply want to <strong><em style="text-decoration: underline;">abort :</em></strong></h3>
					<p>Don't worry, you've got a smaller, but still, important <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ABORT !</span></strong> button (3)on the left of the BIG RED BUTTON!<br />
					Simply press it, other Windows consoles will open, still, don't worry, it's nothing, just the cancellation of the shutdown command!<br/>
					The computer won't stop by itself now!</br>
					<strong>Again, don't worry, it's not bad for your computer, it will shutdown as usual, just make sure you've saved all you files, you can't blaim me for responsable if you forgot to save your files!</strong>

					<h1 id="info">Developer informations:</h1>
					<p>First, let me introduce myself. I'm Ttiki, a game maker and a map maker for the Source Engine and Unity. I'm also a developer in C#, HTML, CSS, PHP, LUA, PYTHON. <br/>
					I've started developping stuff this my elementary school, when I was around 10 or 11. And I've started making map in 2014 and began to make games in 2016.<br/>
					I made this software thanks to the idea of a friend who had to go but also had to turn off his computer while he was out.<br/>
					You can find me on lots of social network, here is a link to a ModDB article where I've put a link to all my profile on social network: <a href="https://www.moddb.com/members/ttiki/blogs/hey-a-new-social-media-askfm">https://www.moddb.com/members/ttiki/blogs/hey-a-new-social-media-askfm</a><br/>
					If you have any questio about this sofwate or if you found a bug, send me <a href="mailto:clem64.combier@gmail.com" subject=".HitMan bug found">an e-mail</a></p>
					<br/>
					<hr style="margin-right: 75%;"/>
					<h1 id="legal">Legal informations</h1>
					<p>Ok, this is the tricky part. I don't know anything about legal stuff, so if you decided to be a bad person (to speak politely), I won't be able to do anything against you. But if you are a nice person, who isn't an a**hole, please, don't copy this software and tell everybody it's yours.<br/>
					First of all, maybe, you will be insulted by some developer as this software is really not beautiful and optimise at all.<br/>
					You can open the code, test things, copy some part of the code to try thing, or just simply take a look, but don't copy paste everything and change my name into yours, please.<br/>
					Thank you.</p>
					<br/>
